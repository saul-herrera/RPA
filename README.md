# RPA
Random Phase Approximation for tight binding models in k-space.

**Under development**

For a tight binding model of ABC trilayer graphene, you can already:

- Generate a k-mesh covering the first Brillouin Zone, taking into account periodic boundary conditions.
- Diagonalize.
- Calculate the polarizability or optical conductivity within linear response theory.
